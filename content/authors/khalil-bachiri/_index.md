## About Me

My research interests lie in Machine Learning and Data Science, with a focus on developing innovative solutions for multi-modal learning, unsupervised learning, graph learning, neural networks, and recommendation systems.
With a strong foundation in machine learning, data analysis, and algorithm development, I strive to bridge the gap between theoretical research and impactful real-world applications.

I am a PhD student at ETIS, CY Cergy Paris Université, where I also serve as an Assistant Professor. Additionally, I work as an AI Research Engineer at CNRS.

I hold a Master's degree in Machine Learning and Data Science from Sorbonne Paris Nord University, a Master's degree in Data Mathematics from Sorbonne Paris Nord University, and a Master's degree in Applied Mathematics from the Faculty of Science Fez.
